Asphalt shingle roof replacements generally range from $6,000 to $18,000 for average homes; metal and tile roofs cost more.

Asphalt shingles last 15\u201325 years, higher-grade architectural shingles 25\u201330 years, metal roofs 30+ years, and clay or concrete tiles 50+ years. Coastal exposure and storms can shorten lifespans, so annual inspections and prompt repairs are recommended."
